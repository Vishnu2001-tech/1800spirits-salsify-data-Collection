# 1800 Spirits Salsify Data Load

This project is designed to facilitate the extraction and transformation of data related to liquor and wine formats for 1800 Spirits. The project includes various scripts and notebooks for processing input data and generating output files.

## Project Structure

- **testing-files**: Contains files for testing the extraction scripts.
- **liquor_format_extract.ipynb**: Jupyter Notebook for extracting and processing liquor format data.
- **Output_files**: Directory for storing the output files generated by the notebooks.
- **input_folders**: Directory for storing input files required by the notebooks.
- **wine_format_extract.ipynb**: Jupyter Notebook for extracting and processing wine format data.
- **single_file_test**: Directory or file for testing with a single file.
- **.git**: Git repository containing version control information.

## Prerequisites

Before running the notebooks, ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Necessary Python packages (can be installed using `requirements.txt` if provided)

## Setup

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd 1800spirits-salsify-data-load
    ```
3. Install the required packages:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

### Liquor Format Extraction

1. Open the Jupyter Notebook for liquor format extraction:
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook liquor_format_extract.ipynb
    ```
2. Follow the instructions within the notebook to process the input data and generate the output files.

### Wine Format Extraction

1. Open the Jupyter Notebook for wine format extraction:
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook wine_format_extract.ipynb
    ```
2. Follow the instructions within the notebook to process the input data and generate the output files.

## Input and Output

- **Input Files**: Place the necessary input files in the `input_folders` directory.
- **Output Files**: The generated output files will be stored in the `Output_files` directory.

## Testing

To test the scripts, use the files provided in the `testing-files` directory. Additional tests can be performed using the `single_file_test` directory.
